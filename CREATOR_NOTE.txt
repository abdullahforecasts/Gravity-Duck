    --------------------------------------------

    Project Purpose:
    Gravity Duck is more than just a platformer‚Äîit's a call to awareness. 
    Through gameplay and symbolism, this game reflects the real-world brutality ducks face 
    in industries of fashion, meat, and entertainment. Each trap, wall, and obstacle 
    is a metaphor‚Äîan echo of the suffering often ignored.

    --------------------------------------------

    Awareness & Advocacy:

    Inspired by real-life investigations and reports such as:

    - ‚ÄúFeathers Flying: The Cruelty Behind Down Products‚Äù  
      [PETA Article](https://www.peta.org/features/live-plucked-down/)  
      
    - ‚ÄúBillions of Male Ducklings Ground Up Alive‚Äù  
      [PETA Report](https://www.peta.org/blog/chicks-ground-up-alive/)  

    You can learn more and support efforts against animal cruelty at [PETA.org].

    You are also encouraged to **donate to organizations like PETA** working for animal justice.
